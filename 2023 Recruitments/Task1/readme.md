Intro to Cybersec from my side ðŸ˜„

```diff
+ Just like in competitive programming, we write code to solve a problem, we create solve scripts to solve some kind of challenge
+ in cybersecurity. Python is one of the preferred languages when it comes to creating solve scipts. Don't worry if you are new with 
+ Python. Solve scripts are nothing but a code which automates any manual operation or task. 

+ Suppose, there is a site which asks you to guess a 3 letter word and if a letter is correct then it displays green else red. Since,
+ it is a 3 lettered word, we can try some cases and eventually find the word. But what if the length was 1000,\we possibly cannot decode
+ the word manually. Here, we can make use of Python. This was just an example but you noticed, how automation may solve our problems.

+ What Cybersecurity teaches you is the indepth knowledge of whatever you are learning. It equips you with all the skills needed to tackle
+ any kind of digital flaws and risks. So if you are finding it interesting, let's move forward.
```

If you are done with part 1 and 2, let's start with Cryptography !!

### Cryptography 

---

Hope you know by now that all the information is available online and you are one search away from learning.
Now, i leave up to you explore and read stuff.

We will start with Ciphers. 

Q1. Find out the 5 most common used Ciphers.
Q2. What are monoalphabetic substitution Ciphers.
Q3. Symmetric and Assymetric encryptions.
Q4. RSA algorithm and Exclusive OR operation.

After having answered all these questions, you can solve the challenges of task1.zip

Thank you ðŸ˜„
