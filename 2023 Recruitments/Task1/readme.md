Just like in competitive programming, we write code to solve a problem, we create solve scripts to solve some kind of challenge
in cybersecurity. Python is one of the preferred languages when it comes to creating solve scipts. Don't worry if you are new with 
Python. Solve scripts are nothing but a code which automates any manual operation or task. 

Suppose, there is a site which asks you to guess a 3 letter word and if a letter is correct then it displays green else red. Since,
it is a 3 lettered word, we can try some cases and eventually find the word. But what if the length was 1000,\we possibly cannot decode
the word manually. Here, we can make use of Python. This was just an example but you noticed, how automation may solve our problems.

What Cybersecurity teaches you is the depth knowledge of whatever you are learning. It equips you with all the skills needed to tackle
any kind of digital flaws and risks. So if you are finding it interesting, let's move forward.
